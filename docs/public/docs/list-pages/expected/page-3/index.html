<body><h1>This is the third page</h1><p>I know you&#39;re out there. I can feel you now. I know that you&#39;re afraid... you&#39;re afraid of us. You&#39;re afraid of change. I don&#39;t know the future. I didn&#39;t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it&#39;s going to begin. I&#39;m going to hang up this phone, and then I&#39;m going to show these people what you don&#39;t want them to see. I&#39;m going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.</p>
