# Bob the static site builder

Bob is a static site generator built on top of the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime.

## Features

Bob is designed for creating extremely performant websites that require near-instant content updating and network edge personalization. All with best-in-class developer experience.

### üöÄ Extremely performant websites

- Minimal CSS footprint (coming soon)
  Include only the CSS needed for each page to keep CSS size as small as possible.

### ‚ö° Near-instant content updating

- Incremental builds
  Build only what is needed in order to be extremely fast.
- Incremental deploy (coming soon)
  Deploy only changed content.

### üåê Network-edge personalization

- Personalize pages on the edge, without client-side Javascript (coming soon)
  Create complex rules and change the page based on request parameters, such as visitor country or cookie values. Use this to create A/B tests, GDPR banners, or product recommendations. This requires the Cloudflare hosting plugin.

### ü§ì Best-in-class developer experience

- Fully typed using TypeScript
  Intellisense and type checking in layout templates.
- Highly modular
  Everything is a module internally, increasing customizability and maintainability.
- Structure your layouts any way you like
  The only thing that is needed is a function that takes a content page and renders it into HTML. The rest is up to you. Use template literals, JSX (example coming soon), or any other way to make this happen.
- Easily create client-side components (coming soon)
  Create client-side code right in your layout files.

## Installation

You need to have the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime installed. When you have it installed, just run:

```
deno install -A [PATH TO CMD.TS]
```

## Usage

See the `demo` directory for an example implementation.

### Layout files

Structure your layout files as you wish, and export a renderer function from a file named `site.ts`. This function will be called with a `ContentFile` for each content page that should be rendered.

### Content files

Add Markdown content files to the `content` directory as needed. Each content file will be rendered into an HTML file using the corresponding path into the `public` directory.
