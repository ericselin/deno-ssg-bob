I can feel you now. I know that you&#39;re afraid... you&#39;re afraid of us. You&#39;re afraid of change. I don&#39;t know the future. I didn&#39;t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it&#39;s going to begin. I&#39;m going to hang up this phone, and then I&#39;m going to show these people what you don&#39;t want them to see. I&#39;m going to show them a world without you.</article></main></body>
