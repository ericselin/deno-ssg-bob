Define your layout(s) and write some content. It could not be easier to get going - it "just works".

## Introduction

`bob` uses TSX for templating, which lends itself very well for a modern workflow. Everything is fully typed via Typescript, and as modular as you like.

All of your content lives in the same folder, which mirrors your website structure. E.g. a `blog/post.md` content file gets the full URL `/blog/post/index.html`.

Markdown files in the content folder (`.md`) are redered into HTML, while all other files are copied as-is to the `public` directory.

Example folder structure:

```
site root
â””-- content
|   â””-- index.md      <-- https://example.com/
|   â””-- blog
|       â””-- index.md  <-- https://example.com/blog/
|       â””-- post.md   <-- https://example.com/blog/post/
â””-- layouts
    â””-- _default.tsx  <-- default layout file
    â””-- index.tsx     <-- layout file for index.md
```

Each content file is rendered independently using a layout file based on a layout file lookup order. There is no other magic involved - no base layouts, no partials and nothing like that. However, by importing other layouts and components using stardard ES6 imports, you can create even the most complex layouts. See below!

## 1. Define your layout(s)

In the `layouts` directory, create a `_default.tsx` file with the below contents. This is the default layout file used.

code:layouts/_default.tsx

The above default layout uses the `Base` component, which in our case holds the main HTML skeleton. This is not a requirement by the engine - structuring your layouts is completely up to you! Below is the base component. Note that while `bob` requires you to export layouts as default, components (such as the base) can be consumed in any way. Here we have opted for a named export.

code:layouts/_base.tsx

You can see that we have used `children` in the same way React and React-like libraries do. This is probably a good time to mention the [jsx pragma comment](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx) used to inform the Typescript compiler that we want to use the imported `h` function for creating JSX elements.

If you want, create a layout file specific for the root index page.

code:layouts/index.tsx

## 2. Create some content

Creating content is really up to you! But you can of course use the following as a starting point:

code:content/index.md

Please create (or copy over!) more content and make something awesome ðŸ˜Ž.

## Result

This is the resulting index page, which uses the `layouts/index.tsx` layout.

iframe:expected/index.html
