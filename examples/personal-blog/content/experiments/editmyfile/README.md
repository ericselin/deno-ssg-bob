# Simple text editor

This is a test of the Filesystem API. It's a very simple text editor. Use at your own risk... 😏

The Filesystem API is freaking amazing. With it you can magically open _local_ files and also save them back! 
The API is in "Origin trial" from Chrome 78 onwards, and available as a flag in previous versions.

The API is pretty damn cool, if you ask me. This is a quite nice looking text editor with a contenteditable
`pre` tag, and the code is not many lines long. Soon the days of native desktop apps are over! 😝
