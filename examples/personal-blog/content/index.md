I like to code. And I like to develop new things. Most of all, I'm an
entrepreneur at heart.

### Coding

Elegant code is the dream. Simple solutions are the best.

### Entrepreneurship

Test early and often because it's fun and effective.

## Projects

### Finnish Baby Box

This is my current day job. I manage the technical implementation of our
custom-built ecommerce solution. Official title: co-founder and CTO.

### Humla

I tried every todo app out there and finally decided to make my own that
works the way I want. Active users: 3.
