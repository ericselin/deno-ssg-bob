# Thougts on how to organize work

1.6.2020:
Not a super good day. Tomorrow, more focus on what is needed: clearer next steps and clearer structure on how the solution should look. Do not use Google tasks in the future. Also, some way to get Outlook events to the main calendar is needed.

2.6.2020:
Pretty ok today. Good to have pomodoros and clear next steps written down. Also, don't do many things simultaneously.

3.6.2020:
Write down everything in humla. Focus on one task at a time.

8.6.2020:
TRO-style daily reviews might be enough? Especially if there is basically one thing on the todo list. Still need a better weekly review (than TRO), because was quite stressed yesterday Sunday.

9.6.2020:
Try to structure CSS according to modules from the beginning. I.e. think twice, code once.

16.6.2020:
Write down what you're doing, step by step. This makes it easier to focus on one thing and avoid getting caught up in weird things. Also, pomodoros!

Really do pomodoros so you don't kill yourself.
